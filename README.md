This is an attempt to make a linux box usable by a xbox remote.
It's far from done but I'm putting it online anyway. The next 
time I have some free time to work on this I think I'll probably
scale my goal back a bit. Originally, this was designed to be a
"desktop environment" in that it would launch from a login 
manager. Now I'm thinking that the next time I work on it I'll 
focus a bit more on what's important, controlling a linux box.
So to that end, I'll aim it more at being a stand-in application
launcher and dock, along with some other functionality such as
file browser, media player front-end.
